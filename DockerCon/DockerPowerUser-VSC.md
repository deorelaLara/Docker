# Become a Docker Power User With Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Una de las multiples ventajas que nos ofrece Visual Studio Code es su extencion Docker. 

When we expand and utilize the VS Code Docker plugin, we can take our projects and Docker skills to the next level. In addition to using VS Code, we streamline our Docker Desktop development workflow with less context switching and built-in shortcuts. Will learn how to bootstrap new projects, quickly write Dockerfiles utilizing templates, build, run, and interact with containers all from VS Code.

### What can I do with the Docker Extension?
1. **Bootstrap** New Docker Projects
    If we create a Python file without dockerfile or Docker compose 
    visual studio code can created a Dockerfile and a Compose file 
    automatically for me. Just based on what's in the directory. 
2. **Interact** with Containers, Images, Volumes, Networks and Docker Hosts
3. **Write** Dockerfiles with code completion
    We can look up images from Docker Hub and the tag directly from your code 
4. **Build & Debug**  Compose and Dockerfile
5. **Connect** to different Docker Servers
